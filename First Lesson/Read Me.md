# My First Repository
## Writting my first Markdown file
Writing my first readme file using markdown wasn't an easy task at first, but through more familiarization with markdown I'm able to grasp the concept briefly. I learn a few things, like how to make **bold** words, *italic* words, ***the combination of both bold and italic***, how to put links [Click Here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) you can learn it too if you want. But still, it will take more time for me to fully understand and fluently create a markdown file.
